OK

- A - length of LFO in patterns (A x 100 so you can make it a specific and large number of patterns with one decimal point)

The pattern lengths do not matter. A length of 2.5 will reset in the middle of the one, two, THIRD pattern in the sequence.
It would be nice to add support cases for specific fractions of patterns like 1/3, 1/4, etc

- B - the midpoint or slope or shape of the LFO

0 = upward saw, between = triangle of varying midpoint, 1 = downward saw

- C - offset

offset where the lfo begins so if your song doesn't start until pattern sequence five, you can have it start there!
